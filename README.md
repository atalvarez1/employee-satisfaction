# Employee Satisfaction Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes employee satisfaction levels based on various factors such as the number of projects, average monthly hours, salary levels, and more. The goal is to identify key drivers of satisfaction and provide actionable insights for improving employee engagement and retention.

## Dataset
The dataset includes self-reported satisfaction scores (0-100%), employer-reported performance scores, and a number of other features both continuous, discrete, and categorical. There are 15,000 records in the dataset.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize relationships between different features and satisfaction levels.
- Identify key insights and recommendations to improve employee satisfaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library used for handling and processing the dataset.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used alongside Seaborn for creating detailed plots and charts.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for numerical operations and handling arrays.

## Project Methods
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - In this section, we handle missing values, correct column names, and encode categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - We explore the dataset to uncover initial insights and patterns.
3. Key Visualizations - Correlation Matrix, Scatterplots, Boxplots, Histograms
